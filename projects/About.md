I'm Louis, animator and illustrator. That's it. It's almost impossible to find this website via web search, so chances are I told you to go to this address. Thanks for doing what I asked.

#### **Contact**

Please send any inquiries [to louis@louissnow.com](mailto:louis@louissnow.com) if you would like to ask about a commission or if there's anything about my work that you'd like to know.

#### **Site Credits**
 
Special thanks to Joe and Robin for helping me set this site up. It was created with the [Portfolio Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/LeNPaul/portfolio-jekyll-theme).
